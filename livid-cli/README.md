# livid-cli

Dister builds and bundles your wasm web app.

## Installation
`cargo install livid-cli`

## Requirements
- wasm32-unknown-unknown target:

`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

- Wasm-bindgen:

`cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`

- Wasm-opt (optional, wasm-opt is called if found in PATH and the --release flag is passed to `livid build`).

It can be downloaded from the [binaryen repo's releases](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases).

## Usage
```
USAGE:
    livid <SUBCOMMAND>

SUBCOMMANDS:
    build     Build your wasm web app
    clean     Clean output artifacts
    serve     Serve the generated index.html
    --help    Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

From the manifest directory of your wasm rust applications directory, run:
`livid build` or `livid build --release`

It should generate a dist folder in the manifest directory. The generated html index file can then be served by any server or by running `livid serve`. If you prefer to use another server for development, pass the dist directory to the server:
`python3 -m http.server --dir dist`

If livid-cli finds an index.html shell in the manifest directory, it will use it and replace the `{{SCRIPT}}`  placeholder (Ã  la emscripten shell html) with a script to load the generated js glue code.
